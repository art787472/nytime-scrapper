Engineers From Taiwan Bolstered China’s Chip Industry. Now They’re Leaving.,台灣工程師曾助推中國晶片行業，如今他們正在離開
"TAIPEI, Taiwan — The job offer from a Chinese semiconductor company was appealing. A higher salary. Work trips to explore new technologies.",台灣台北——一家中國的半導體公司提供的工作機會很有吸引力。薪水更高。還可以公費出差去考察新技術。
"No matter that it would be less prestigious for Kevin Li than his job in Taiwan at one of the world’s leading chip makers. Mr. Li eagerly moved to northeast China in 2018, taking part in a wave of corporate migration as the Chinese government moved aggressively to build up its semiconductor industry.",但對凱文·李來說，開出的條件再好，還是不如他在台灣一家全球領先的晶片製造商上班體面。2018年，中國政府大力發展半導體行業之際，凱文·李迫不及待地搬到中國東北，成為一波企業遷徙潮中的一員。
"He went back to Taiwan after two years, as Covid-19 swept through China and global tensions intensified. Other highly skilled Taiwanese engineers are going home, too.",兩年後，隨著新冠疫情席捲中國，全球緊張局勢加劇，他回到了台灣。其他一些掌握高技能的台灣工程師也紛紛打道回府。
"For many, the strict pandemic measures have been tiresome. Geopolitics has made the job even more fraught, with China increasingly vocal about staking its claim on Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy. The Taiwanese government has begun to discourage local engineers from going to China, concerned that they were taking proprietary information with them.",對許多人來說，嚴格的防疫措施已經夠令人煩了。地緣政治使得工作變得更加讓人焦慮，因為中國越來越強烈地提出對民主自治的台灣的主權要求。台灣政府開始勸阻工程師前往中國工作，擔心他們帶走專業情報。
"“Some who went to work in China were villains who exchanged secrets for money,” said Mr. Li, 40. “Some wanted to be free from the work pressures in Taiwan. And there were those who seriously wanted to explore new areas.”",「過去（中國工作）的人，就是一些帶機密換財富的小人，」40歲的凱文·李說。「有想脫離在台灣工作壓力的人，有認真想去拓荒的人。」
"The prospects that enticed Taiwanese engineering talent to China, feeding a pipeline for lagging Chinese semiconductor companies hoping to compete with global rivals, are rapidly diminishing.",吸引台灣工程人才到中國、為希望參與全球競爭但處於落後的中國半導體企業提供人才管道的前景正在迅速消失。
"Semiconductors are now vital strategic assets in the pitched geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. As Washington tries to crimp China’s capacity to make advanced chips, Taiwan, the world’s biggest producer of high-end semiconductors, finds itself at the center of what some are calling the 21st century’s version of the arms race. While President Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, adopted a warmer tone at their first face-to-face presidential meeting this week, it was clear that Taiwan remained a serious point of contention between the two countries.",在美中激烈的地緣政治競爭中，半導體現在是至關重要的戰略資產。隨著華盛頓試圖削弱中國製造先進晶片的能力，世界上最大的高端半導體生產地——台灣——發現自己處於一些人所謂的21世紀版軍備競賽的中心。雖然拜登總統和中國國家主席習近平在本週舉行的雙方首次面對面會晤中採取了較為溫和的語氣，但很明顯，台灣仍然是兩國之間一個嚴重的爭議點。
"Taiwan itself faces increasing unease in Washington. The secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo, and others have said that, even though the United States continues to support Taiwan militarily, it needs to be less dependent on the island democracy for the chips needed in sophisticated weapons.",台灣自身在華盛頓也面臨著日益加劇的不安。商務部長吉娜·雷蒙多等人表示，雖然美國繼續在軍事上支持台灣，但它需要在先進武器所需的晶片方面減少對這個民主島嶼的依賴。
"Sweeping bans imposed by the Biden administration last month targeting China’s chip industry have put the island’s premier chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, on the front line of likely disruptions to the global supply chain. Adding to the pressure, the Biden administration has pressed TSMC into building a plant in Arizona to help diversify the United States’ sources of chips.",拜登政府上個月對中國晶片行業實施全面禁令，將台灣主要的晶片製造商台積電推到了可能出現的全球供應鏈擾動的前沿。此外，拜登政府還向台積電施壓，要求它在亞利桑那州設廠，幫助美國實現晶片來源的多元化。
"Beijing has blasted the new rules, saying they “will not only harm Chinese companies’ legitimate rights and interests but also hurt the interests of U.S. companies.” And the Chinese government, which is pushing its own strategy of self-reliance in key areas like semiconductors, is expected to retaliate in ways that could punish TSMC.",北京抨擊了美國的新舉措，稱它們「不僅損害了中國企業的合法權益，也會對美國企業造成嚴重影響」。中國政府正在半導體等關鍵領域推行自力更生戰略，預計它將以可能波及台積電的方式進行報復。
"The Chinese government, for example, could bar the American companies that build data centers in China from using high-end chips manufactured by TSMC, said Jason Hsu, a former Taiwanese legislator who is now at the Harvard Kennedy School.",例如，中國政府可以禁止在中國建立數據中心的美國公司使用台積電生產的高端晶片，台灣前立法委員、現就職於哈佛大學甘迺迪學院的許毓仁表示。
"So far, TSMC said, the impact of the new rules has been limited. The administration granted a one-year waiver to the company, allowing it to continue expanding its facility in the Chinese city of Nanjing. TSMC also has a plant in Shanghai.",台積電錶示，到目前為止，新規定的影響有限。政府給予該公司為期一年的豁免，允許其繼續擴大在南京的生產設施。台積電在上海也有一家工廠。
"But Washington has barred Chinese and Taiwanese engineers with U.S. citizenship or a green card from working in China’s chip-making facilities. The ban will force about 200 Chinese and Taiwanese engineers to either leave China or give up their U.S. citizenship, Mr. Hsu said.",但華盛頓禁止擁有美國國籍或綠卡的中國大陸和台灣工程師在中國的晶片製造工廠工作。許毓仁說，這項禁令將迫使大約200名大陸和台灣工程師離開中國或放棄其美國公民身份。
"“This has such a chilling effect on every Taiwanese national working in the semiconductor industry in China. Everyone is on edge,” Mr. Hsu said. “What if a U.S. government intelligence agency thinks you are violating U.S. security and wants to arrest you?”",「這讓每一個在中國半導體行業工作的台灣人都產生了寒蟬效應。所有人都很緊張，」許毓仁說。「如果美國政府情報機構認為你侵犯了美國的安全，要逮捕你，怎麼辦？」
"For years, China poached Taiwan’s semiconductor engineers, who often have Ph.D.s and are essential to keeping the world’s most advanced chip-making factories humming.",多年來，中國大陸一直在挖走台灣的半導體工程師，這些工程師通常擁有博士學位，對維持世界上最先進的晶片製造工廠的運轉至關重要。
"In 2019, about 3,000 Taiwanese semiconductor engineers were working in China, nearly 10 percent of the 40,000 engineers at the heart of the industry’s work force, according to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, an independent group.",根據獨立組織台灣經濟研究院的數據，2019年，約有3000名台灣半導體工程師在中國大陸工作，占該行業勞動力中四萬名核心工程師的近10%。
"A handful of senior executives also joined rival Chinese firms, including the country’s most prestigious, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, which is based in Shanghai. Chinese state entities are among the company’s major shareholders, and the Pentagon has expressed concerns that SMIC has ties to the Chinese military. SMIC did not respond to requests for comment.",少數高管也加入了中國競爭對手的公司，包括中國最負盛名的中芯國際，其總部位於上海。中芯國際的主要股東包括了政府實體，五角大廈對中芯國際與中國軍方有聯繫表示了擔憂。中芯國際沒有回應記者的置評請求。
"One former TSMC executive, Liang Mong-song, a prized engineer who had been the company’s director of research and development, joined SMIC as co-chief executive in 2017. Last year, China’s state-run media reported that Mr. Liang led a team of engineers who developed SMIC’s seven-nanometer chip technology, a more advanced chip than the company had previously made, and a sudden breakthrough that partly drove the Biden administration to announce its new rules.",台積電的前高管梁孟松是一位受人尊敬的工程師，曾任公司研發總監，2017年加入中芯國際，擔任聯席首席執行官。去年，中國官方媒體報導稱，梁孟松帶領一個工程師團隊開發了中芯國際的七納米晶片技術，這比中芯國際之前生產的晶片更先進，是一項突如其來的突破，在一定程度上推動了拜登政府宣布新規定。
"Another former TSMC senior executive, Chiang Shang-yi, had hoped to work on a new method of producing microchips at the Shanghai company. In an interview this year with the Computer History Museum in California, he said going to China was “one of the foolish things” that he had done. Mr. Chiang left SMIC last year.",台積電另一位前高管蔣尚義曾希望在這家上海公司研究一種生產微晶片的新方法。在今年接受加州計算機歷史博物館採訪時，他表示，去中國是他做過的「一件蠢事」。蔣尚義去年離開了中芯國際。
"Taking a job at a Chinese company has always been dicey for Taiwanese engineers, said Syaru Shirley Lin, a Taiwanese economist and a former partner at Goldman Sachs specializing in the tech industry. “People would say, ‘Did you go there?’” she said. “Soon, it will be like going to the Soviet Union during the Cold War.”",曾在高盛擔任科技行業合伙人的台灣經濟學家林夏如說，對台灣工程師來說，在大陸公司工作一直是件冒險的事。「人們會說，『你去過那裡嗎？』」她說。「很快，就會像去冷戰時期的蘇聯一樣。」
"Evonne Wang, 31, looked for a job in China to broaden her experience beyond TSMC.",31歲的伊芳·王在中國找了一份工作，以擴大自己在台積電以外的經驗。
"Several headhunting firms offered her opportunities, but she settled on an American company based in China. She figured that if she went to a Chinese company her reputation might be tarnished when she returned home.",幾家獵頭公司給她提供了機會，但她最終選擇了一家設在中國的美國公司。她想，如果她去了一家中國公司，回台灣後她的聲譽可能會受損。
"“Some Taiwanese semiconductor companies have qualms about previous experiences of working in China,” said Ms. Wang, who also returned to Taiwan as Covid took hold.",「有的台灣半導體公司會對之前在中國的工作經驗有疑慮，」伊芳·王說，她也在新冠疫情暴發時返回了台灣。
"With China making industry advances, Taiwan has begun to take measures to stop the brain drain and protect a core economic driver. The island’s economy grew more than 6 percent last year, in part from the surge in global demand for semiconductors.",隨著中國大陸工業的進步，台灣已開始採取措施，阻止人才流失，保護一個核心經濟驅動力。台灣經濟去年增長超過6%，部分原因是全球對半導體的需求激增。
"Gin Chang, 30, a Taiwanese engineer who worked in southern China for a year and doubled his salary, said he understood the growing unease in Taiwan about its young engineers’ contributing to China’s growth.",30歲的台灣工程師金·張（音）在中國南方工作了一年，工資翻了一番。他說，他理解台灣對其年輕工程師為中國經濟增長做出貢獻而日益感到不安。
"“I don’t think there should be restrictions on us working in China,” Mr. Chang said. “But from the perspective of the government in Taiwan, if the Chinese economy grows because of its growing semiconductor industry, then Taiwan’s economic situation could be endangered.”",「我認為我們在中國工作不應該受到限制，」金·張說。「但從台灣政府的角度來看，如果中國大陸經濟增長是因為其不斷增長的半導體產業，那麼台灣的經濟形勢可能會受到威脅。」
"Under regulations introduced in early 2021, headhunters in Taiwan are barred from advertising jobs in China’s microchip industry. The Ministry of Justice established a task force that ordered raids on Chinese firms operating in Taiwan. The Chinese companies were suspected of being fronts created to recruit local engineers for jobs in China; more than 40 cases of poaching workers and stealing secrets have been prosecuted since last year, the government said in September.",根據2021年初出台的規定，台灣獵頭公司不得發布關於中國微晶片行業的招聘廣告。台灣法務部成立了一個特別工作組，會受命突查在台運營的中國企業。這些中國企業被懷疑是為招聘當地工程師到中國工作而設的幌子；台灣政府9月表示，自去年以來，已經起訴了40多起挖角和竊密案件。
"Much of the poaching involved Chinese companies trying to capture Taiwanese expertise, applying that knowledge in their plants and then ditching the workers, said one headhunter, Michael Lo.",一位名叫麥可·盧（音）的獵頭表示，大部分挖角行為都與試圖獲取台灣專業技能的中國企業有關，它們會將這些知識應用到自己的工廠，然後解僱工人。
"“China’s corporate culture is just three words: ‘Raise and kill,’” Mr. Lo said. “It will first cultivate you and spend lots of money and resources on you, then steal your technologies and, finally, fire you,” he said.",「大陸的企業文化就是三個字：養套殺，」麥可·盧說。「先培養你，在你身上花很多錢和資源，然後竊取你的技術，最後解僱你。」
"Mr. Li, the engineer who went back home, had worked his way up the Taiwanese semiconductor industry. He had four jobs at smaller companies before joining TSMC at its headquarters in Hsinchu Science Park, a campus sometimes known as Taiwan’s Silicon Valley, 30 minutes by high-speed train from Taipei, the capital.",那位回國的工程師凱文·李曾在台灣半導體行業一路摸爬滾打。在加入新竹科學園——該園區有時被稱為台灣「矽谷」，從首都台北乘高鐵30分鐘即可抵達——的台積電總部之前，他曾在規模較小的企業做過四份工作。
"TSMC is the pride of Taiwan. Visitors to its main building, set in lush foliage, are greeted by a striking sign with the name of the company’s founder, Morris Chang. One of Taiwan’s multibillionaires, Mr. Chang, 91, grew up in China, attended Harvard and M.I.T. and worked at Texas Instruments before starting TSMC in 1987.",台積電是台灣的驕傲。其主樓坐落於蔥鬱樹林之中，來訪者會看到一個醒目的標誌，上面寫著公司創始人張忠謀的名字。現年91歲的張忠謀是台灣的億萬富豪之一，在中國長大，曾就讀於哈佛大學和麻省理工學院。在1987年創辦台積電之前，他曾在德州儀器工作。
"When Mr. Li arrived at TSMC, he felt lucky but found it a slog inside the foundry, he said.",當凱文·李來到台積電，他說感覺自己很幸運，但發現在代工廠裡幹活的日子很艱苦。
"“I had the feeling of being a small screw most when working in TSMC,” Mr. Li said. “Going to China was like looking forward to a place without the constraints of an outdated framework. You can take the plunge by going there.”",「我在台積時有『小螺絲釘』的感受，」凱文·李說。「到中國是期待一個沒有陳舊框架的束縛，可以放手去幹。」
"For now, Mr. Li is staying in Taiwan, working for an American chip company operating there and siding with the invigorated patriotic sentiment and the ethos of individual liberty.",目前，凱文·李留在台灣，為一家在台運營的美國晶片企業工作，他支持高漲的愛國情緒，也崇尚個體自由的精神。
"“The advantage of working in Taiwan is that you don’t have to worry about officials shutting down the whole company because of one thought,” he said. “The atmosphere is very important. At least I can watch all kinds of programs criticizing the governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait without worrying about being arrested.”",「台灣工作的優點就是不用擔心官員一轉念就收掉，」他說。「自由的空氣也很重要，至少我可以隨便看各種批評兩岸的節目，不用擔心被抓。」
